Research Paper for SRPP-UH 2410Q Gender and Society 
How does whether a gendered language is spoken at home impact an individual’s gender ideology?

I explore how language affects the speakers’ perception of women in a society by using a measure of whether various languages are gendered, using the sixth wave of World Values Survey (WVS) data, collected through 2010 to 2014. This paper aims to answer the main question of: How does whether a gendered language is spoken at home impact an individual’s gender ideology? Further, the paper addresses sub research questions through its control and interaction models such as: Whether gendered language has more of an effect on ideology for women? Whether gendered language has more of an effect on ideology for higher education?
